{"itemno":148001,"headline":"EV GROUP SMARTVIEW® BOND ALIGNER","description":"2005 SmartView&reg; Semi-Automated Wafer-to-Wafer Bond Aligner     The EV Group (EVG) Smartview&reg; Bond aligner and EV Group (EVG) 540 Wafer Bonder are used in the production of MEMs and in the emerging fields of 3D IC Packaging and Through-Silicon Via (TSV) interconnects.  A 3D integrated circuit (3D IC) is a single integrated circuit built by stacking silicon wafers and/or dies and interconnecting them vertically. This is achieved by persisly aligning devices on two silicon wafers and subsequently bonding them together. The result is they behave as a single device. By using TSV technology, 3D ICs can pack a great deal of functionality into a small &ldquo;footprint.&rdquo; This technology is not olny used in the production of MEMS, but also in the fabrication of CMOS image sensors, and memory devices.","mfr":"EVG","model":"Smartview Bond Aligner","price":"Best Price","qty":1,"location":"Scotia, NY US","category":"Other Wafer Fabrication Equipment","keywords":"wafer processing processing","unixTimeStamp":1340202033,"popular":12,"isFeatured":0,"categories.lvl0":"Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment","categories.lvl1":"Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment > Wafer Fabrication Equipment","categories.lvl2":"Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment  >  Wafer Fabrication Equipment > Other Wafer Fabrication Equipment","specstable":"<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Manufacturer </td><td class=\"txt\">EVG</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txtb\">Model </td><td class=\"txt\">Smartview Bond Aligner </td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Description </td><td class=\"txt\">300mm Wafer to Wafer Bond Aligner </td></tr><tr class=\"alt\" ><td class=\"txtb\">Wafer Size Range </td><td> </td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txt\"> Minimum </td><td>150 mm</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Maximum </td><td>300 mm</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txt\"> Set Size </td><td>300 mm</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txtb\">Other Information </td><td class=\"txt\"><p>&bull; High resolution alignment stage with DC servomotors in X, Y and Theta<br /> &bull; Alignment accuracy +/- 1 um (one sigma) with 20x objectives<br /> &bull; Top and bottom stage with precision measurement system<br /> &bull; Complete computer control of all mechanical movements in the aligner.<br /> &bull; 17\" flat screen for operator interface and alignment functions<br /> &bull; Joystick control of all alignment movements and microscope movement in Z.<br /> &bull; Unique three spindle alignment stage for shift free Z movements<br /> &bull; Remote Diagnostics via modem</p></td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Year of Manufacture </td><td class=\"txt\">2005</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txtb\">CE Marked </td><td class=\"txt\">YES</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\" ><td class=\"txtb\">Exterior Dimensions </td><td> </td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Width </td><td>52.000 in (132.1 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txt\"> Depth </td><td>47.000 in (119.4 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Height </td><td>80.000 in (203.2 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Weight </td><td class=\"txt\">1,534 lb (696 kg)</td></tr> </table>","imgbase":"https://www.capovani.com/clientresources/","imgMain":"107/108/43/80543/148001-a-EVGroup_Smartview_main_i148001.jpg","imagesXtra":["107/108/43/80543/148001-1-EVGroup_Smartview_detail1_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-2-EVGroup_Smartview_detail2_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-3-EVGroup_Smartview_detail3_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-4-EVGroup_Smartview_detail4_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-5-EVGroup_Smartview_detail5_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-6-EVGroup_Smartview_detail6_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-7-EVGroup_Smartview_detail7_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-8-EVGroup_Smartview_detail8_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-9-EVGroup_Smartview_detail9_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-10-EVGroup_Smartview_detail10_i148001.jpg","107/108/43/80543/148001-11-EVGroup_Smartview_detail11_i148001.jpg"]}
