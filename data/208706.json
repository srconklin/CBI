In the reflow zone, the user can specify the dwell at both the melting and peak temperatures. Based on these settings, the system will also automatically calculate the heating or cooling rate in each stage for verification with solder paste and component manufacturers' specifications. In addition, when heater control is based on the higher temperature measured at the heaters, the system displays the calculated board temperature based on a calibrated offset.</p></td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Extended Description </td><td class=\"txt\"> Details at <a href=\"/clientresources/107/108/55/555/Obj208706-Manncorp_MC_301N.pdf\">Manncorp MC 301N.pdf</a></td></tr><tr class=\"alt\" ><td class=\"txtb\">Power Requirements </td><td class=\"txt\">200-230 V 20.0 A 50/60 Hz 1 Phase</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Year of Manufacture </td><td class=\"txt\">2014</td></tr> </table>","imgbase":"https://www.capovani.com/clientresources/","imgMain":"107/108/55/555/208706-a-Manncorp-MC-301N-Solder-Reflow-Oven-1.jpg","imagesXtra":["107/108/55/555/208706-1-Manncorp-MC-301N-Solder-Reflow-Oven-1.jpg","107/108/55/555/208706-2-Manncorp-MC-301N-Solder-Reflow-Oven-2.jpg","107/108/55/555/208706-3-Manncorp-MC-301N-Solder-Reflow-Oven-3.jpg","107/108/55/555/208706-4-Manncorp-MC-301N-Solder-Reflow-Oven-4.jpg","107/108/55/555/208706-5-Manncorp-MC-301N-Solder-Reflow-Oven-5.jpg"]}
