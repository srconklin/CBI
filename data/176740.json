Ion polishing is done by two variable angle, miniature Penning ion guns. The operating angle of each gun(&plusmn; 10&deg;) is independent of one another and both have the ability to accurately center the beam onto the specimen at any angle within this range. The Penning guns incorporate powerful rare earth magnets and are capable of very high thinning rates. This makes it possible to thin specimens at very low angles in a reasonably short time. Each gun is mounted in a universal joint so that x and z alignment drives can be used to center the beams on the specimen. An optical microscope may also be used to inspect the specimen in its working position at any time during the thinning process, and also to achieve very precise control over the final stage of specimen thinning. Careful design of the gun's ion optics has virtually eliminated cathode aperture erosion and as a result gun maintenance is rarely required and specimen contamination from the ion gun is minimal. Specimen contamination is also reduced by using an oil free vacuum system which is completely contained within the bench top unit and by using the Gatan single-sided specimen post which eliminates transfer of material onto the specimen by secondary sputtering from the specimen platform. The single-sided specimen post also provides excellent thermal contact with the specimen and prevents specimens from being overheated by the ion beam. The specimen post further has the advantage that it allows the specimen to have an unobstructed view of the ion beam and thus ion polishing can be performed at angles approaching 0&deg;.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>Ion Guns:</strong>Two Penning ion guns with miniature rare earth magnets<br /><strong>Milling angle:</strong> fixed, about 0&deg;<br /><strong>Beam Energy:</strong>1.5keV to 6keV<br /><strong>Beam diameter:</strong>350&micro;m FWHM at 5keV - 800 &micro;m FWHM at 5KeV for Broad Beam guns<br /><strong>Current Density:</strong>10mA/cm2 Peak<br /><strong>Beam alignment:</strong>Precision beam alignment using fluorescent screen<br /><strong>Specimen Stage :</strong> Sample Size:3mm or 2.3mm<br /><strong>Mounting:</strong> Gatan patented DuoPost&trade; (Standard) or Graphite Holder (Optional) (contact us for more information about which mounting options are available)<br /><strong>Rotation:</strong> Variable from 1 to 6rpm<br /><strong>Beam Modulation:</strong> Single or double sector for exceptional cross-sectioning<br /><strong>Vacuum:</strong>Dry Pumping System<br />Molecular drag pump backed by a 2-Stage diaphragm pump<br /><strong>Pressure:</strong> 5E-6Torr base pressure, 8E-5Torr operating pressure<br /><strong>Vacuum gauge:</strong> Penning type for main chamber.
