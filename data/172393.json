{"itemno":172393,"headline":"WEST-BOND SEMIAUTOMATIC WEDGE BONDER","description":"Semi-Automatic Wedge Bonder   Model 4500B operates under microprocessor control with user-programmed memory to stitch bond a succession of parallel multi-arch wires, requiring an operator only to position the critical bond target. Each increment of motion of tool and work in both Z and Y directions is chosen by stepper motors under program control so that the resulting wire connections have identical shapes. This is ideal for bonding high power, high frequency devices where it is necessary to hold the mutual inductance of parallel wires constant.","mfr":"West-Bond","model":"4500B","price":"Best Price","qty":1,"location":"Scotia, NY US","category":"Manual Wedge Bonders","keywords":"wire bonders  bonder  wedge bonder  wire bonder","unixTimeStamp":1420805957,"popular":2,"isFeatured":0,"specstable":"<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Manufacturer </td><td class=\"txt\">West-Bond</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txtb\">Model </td><td class=\"txt\">4500B </td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Description </td><td class=\"txt\">Semiautomatic Wedge Bonder </td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txtb\">Accessories </td><td class=\"txt\"><p><br />Heated Work Holder with West Bond 1200D Power Supply<br />Heated tip<br /><br /></p></td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Other Information </td><td class=\"txt\"><p><span style=\"line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><br />The 4500B is a single tool with 45 degree wire feed designed to bond aluminum or gold wires ranging from 0.0007 in. to 0.002 in. </span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"alt\" ><td class=\"txtb\">Power Requirements </td><td class=\"txt\">115 V 2.5 A 50/60 Hz 1 Phase</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\" ><td class=\"txtb\">Exterior Dimensions </td><td> </td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Width </td><td>27.000 in (68.6 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txt\"> Depth </td><td>26.000 in (66.0 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Height </td><td>19.000 in (48.3 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txtb\">Weight </td><td class=\"txt\">92 lb (42 kg)</td></tr> </table>","imgbase":"https://www.capovani.com/clientresources/","imgMain":"107/108/81/76581/172393-a-Westbond-4500B-Semi-Automatic-Wedge-Bonder.jpg","imagesXtra":["107/108/81/76581/172393-1-Westbond-4500B-Semi-Automatic-Wedge-Bonder.jpg","107/108/81/76581/172393-2-Westbond-4500B-Semi-Automatic-Wedge-Bonder-Detail.jpg"]}
