A complete replacement of all IO and signal wiring is performed. None of the original IO is used. A full set of system documentation is provided which includes wiring diagrams, IO listings, OEM equipment spec sheets, and full system software source code.<br><li>MFCs will be sent out for cleaning and recalibration; filters will be replaced.<br><li>Wet clean of process chambers.<br><li>Installation of rebuilt Leybold 361C turbo pump and controller.<br>NB: Please note that the dual chamber configuration is designed to operate sequentially. The RF generator and vacuum sources are shared for each process chamber. However each chamber has its own set of four MFCs.<p> </td></tr><tr class=\"cell\" ><td class=\"txtb\">Exterior Dimensions </td><td> </td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Width </td><td>45.000 in (114.3 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"cell\"><td class=\"txt\"> Depth </td><td>43.000 in (109.2 cm)</td></tr><tr class=\"alt\"><td class=\"txt\"> Height </td><td>73.000 in (185.4 cm)</td></tr> </table>","imgbase":"https://www.capovani.com/clientresources/","imgMain":"107/108/24/76124/3011-a_PlasmaTherm_740-740_i3011_146w200h.jpg","imagesXtra":["107/108/24/76124/3011-1_PlasmaTherm_740-740_dualchambers.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-2_PlasmaTherm_740-740_Etch_chamber.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-3_PlasmaTherm_740-740_Strip_chamber.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-4_PlasmaTherm_740-740_controlpanel.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-5_PlasmaTherm_740-740_fullview_rear.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-6_PlasmaTherm_740-740_rightsidecontrols_interior.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-7_PlasmaTherm_740-740_gaspanel_2.jpg","107/108/24/76124/3011-8_PlasmaTherm_740-740_signal_distribution_panel.jpg"]}
